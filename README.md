# Public transport passengers on board analytics
This project is a simple example of data analytics manipulation in python for data regarding the number of passengers on board of buses in the city of *Cagliari*.

### Example results data analysed

As shown in the picture below the program allows to select a **bus line** and based on the available data the following graph can be produced. To be more precise the structure of the analysis carried out is as following: 

- check the *recursivity* of passangers on board through rush hours in particular days (e.g. all Mondays in 2 months)
- data is sampled at intervals of *15 mins* 
- **x** axis represents the time, while on **y** the number of passengers on board
